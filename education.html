                                <p>The pursuit of Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM) was resumed at SMK Khir Johari, Sungai Sumun, beginning in 2020. 
                                   Pengajian Am, Bahasa Melayu, Geography, and History were all part of the curriculum. Despite the hurdles created by 
                                   the COVID-19 pandemic, all three semesters were completed in less than two years. This endeavour culminated in the 
                                   achievement of the STPM Certificate, which was distinguished by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 2.59 and a 
                                   Malaysian University English Test (MUET) band score of 3.5.</p>
